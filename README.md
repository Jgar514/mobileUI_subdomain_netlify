## Goal:

to design my own user interface for a mobile screen. I wanted to be able to show the most information without vertical scrolling. I got inspiration by the way facebook on a mobile device has horizontal scroll photo cards. It also offers the ability to tab between multiple windows so you can render new information without a page reload.

## Technologies:

React. Vite Tailwind CSS to style my application. Keen-slider for the horizontal card slider. React-Icon Library for social icons
